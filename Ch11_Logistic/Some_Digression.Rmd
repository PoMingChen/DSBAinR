### What's the different between `merge()`, and `xx_join()`?

- 這篇的內容很簡單，就是如下，By Hadley Wickam

join is a plyr function. dplyr has inner_join, left_join, semi_join and anti_join.  The advantages of the dplyr versions over merge are:

* rows are kept in existing order
* much faster
* tells you what keys you're merging by (if you don't supply)
* also work with database tables.
